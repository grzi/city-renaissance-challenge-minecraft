Inspired by an old concept, the city construction challenge, I present you the city renaissance challenge (CRC). It can be done on bedrock or java edition of Minecraft.

## Why this challenge ?
  The main goals of this challenge are to give a guideline of constructions to the player and some objectives to progress. At the end, the player will have a complete city & map.
  Also, there is a start, and an end. (But you’re free to continue on the map after the end). Some steps from this challenge will make the player make some research, look for inspiration. 

  **Be careful :** It’s not meant to be easy or quick. It’s a challenge. Rules may change, but only if there are some incoherences or really really hard stuff to do. 

## How does it work ?
The challenge is divided into 30 chapters. Each one contains a part of the story, and a list of objectives to reach and items to obtain, in order to validate the chapter. If you decide to go for it in multiplayer, each player has to reach each objective.

    <br />
    <blockquote>
        A thousand years ago, following the massive invasion of creepers, the creation of a hundred withers and the invocation of several dragons, the surviving builders from this world have decided to use cryopreservation to keep them safe
        for a millenium. They did this because of the fact that they had absolutely no plans for a building to conduct such a battle, despite the warnings of the population. You were still in training to be a builder, but you witnessed the
        last battle of this time, lost by humans to monsters.
        <br />

        <br />
        Your eyes are wide open, you see nature, water, animals. The area looks calm, but you know you are not completely safe. Now that you’re here, you know that you have a very special mission. The reconstruction of the city. You don’t
        want to reproduce the error of the other ancient builders. But no city was made in one day. You are alone, and not equipped. You will have to start somewhere …

    <br />
    <blockquote>
        You are now well settled in your camp.Your first few nights were a bit difficult though, as it is not very secure. It is time to think about building a bigger and more comfortable house, making you feel safer. You go to the
        surrounding area to find a place that would suit, when you see in the distance, a group of several settlers. It looks like there are 4, but maybe there are more of them. They come on a cart with horses.
        <br /><br />
        You ask them what happened after the battle 1000 years ago. Obviously, these people weren't there, but the story has spread from generation to generation since. The few survivors of this world are those who have managed to hide in
        caves, in reinforced constructions. No one really knows how many survived. According to rumors, the monsters are scattered all over the world.
        <br /><br />
        After this discussion and after discovering that you are part of the ancient people, they decide to settle in this area with you, and you have the task of creating the first hamlet of the new city.

    <blockquote>
        After the installation, your new inhabitants let other people met on their way knowing that they had finally found a place to settle in, thanks to the return of a builder from the old days. This is how 4 new residents are about to
        arrive. You have a choice, enlarge the existing hamlet, or create their own hamlet. Whatever is your choice, you know they will need access to water and food.
        <br /><br />
        When they arrive, you also question them about the situation of the current world from their point of view. According to them, no similar attack has taken place in 1000 years. However, sometimes camps are completely destroyed
        without anyone having an explanation. They also explain to you that an old-time prison was spared and that the survivors of this prison, after escaping, created different tribes which are scattered all over the world.
        <br /><br />
        On the other hand, these new inhabitants would like sugar. They haven't had a chance to have it for 10 years, and you directly thought you could provide them some. Now that you and the new inhabitants have settled in, you realize
        that it becomes necessary to think about creating a temple, or a place of worship, in order to maintain the morale and the beliefs of the population. You also want to have a place to be able to see more far away.

This is Sam Jackson, an isolated farmer, having heard of this emerging city, and the return of a builder from the old days. At first, he seems a little aggressive towards you.

        Sam seems to calm down, he explains to you that since the departure of the builders and their knowledge, the world has not really experienced expansion and a secure area against monsters. You then tell him your version of the last battle, and what you learned and are ready to do today to protect everyone. You also explain to him that you would never have left, leaving other people behind, but that you had

        After a few days of tranquility in your village, while you are resting in your house, you hear a huge explosion in the distance. Then a second. Looking out the window, you see the residents panicking, not knowing what's going on.
        You wear your best armor and decide to go see what is happening. 
        <br /><br />
         When you get there, you come face to face with two strange people. A man and a woman. One claims to be the supreme mage named Liv Jones, the other claims to be a

        It appears that the explosion was a side effect of a half-magic half-scientific technology intended to find
        the village, in order to settle there. Obviously each blames the other for the explosions. But, they seem honest and you become to like them.

        went to another dimension to escape the monsters in this world. They then came back to hide in caves on top of the mountains, where monsters come more rarely.  
        <br /><br />

        legend, it would be possible to create a door to go there, and certain objects being there seem to have a rather important value, as much for you, as for your inhabitants. In addition, it seems that an interesting mineral is found

        to enchant tools and armors is to have these mysterious experience points. Liv, the magician, tells you that the greatest source of experience is a mysterious dragon, living in a dimension called the End. To access it, you must find
        an old stronghold using strange modified pearls. You are jokingly wondering how dimension Liv will make you visit, but you start looking for this stronghold, as soon as she leaves.  
        <br /><br />
        When you arrive in the stronghold, you search this
        old portal and finally find it. Some little creatures keep annoying you, but you manage to place the eyes on the portal, and activate it. Let the battle begin…

        While you’re celebrating your victory against the dragon at the tavern with your friends, you hear the sound of a horn in the distance, followed by an explosion. Everyone is panicking, your inhabitants are running everywhere. You
        calm them down, order them to go back to their houses, and you go to the origin of the noise. No doubt, the outpost is under attack. You put on your best armor, take your potions, your golden apples and go to the battle. No question
        of leaving your friends alone, you worked too hard for that.  
        <br /><br />
        When you get there the battle takes place mainly in front of the outpost. Liv and Lola are there to help. It’s a real bloodbath. You look at your allies, a rage in their
        eyes makes you want to defend them even more. You’re able to feel the centuries of pain, of forced submission, which they are avenging. It's time to give this evil tribe what it deserves.  
        <br /><br />
        After long days of fight, you are finally
        victorious. But not happy. You lost some friends there. Lola is gone. The path, place of the battle, is slowly soaking up the blood of your friends and enemies. The spectacle is macabre.  
        <br /><br />
        However, you know that this was only the
        beginning, and you decide to end this war. You won’t let this happen again. You’re not like your ancestors. You won’t run away and let people die. You ask a cartographer to give you the coordinates of the manor of the Apasok tribe,
        and go, in order to avenge your missing friends...

        a bit more about the initial plan of the ancient builders. Their plan was to send the sacrifices back to the planet first, so as to see if life was possible. It’s for this reason that for now, there is a good chance that the
        returning ancient are in reality only former non-builder inhabitants of the planet, considered as sacrifices.

    <blockquote>
        Now that the population is growing and the exploits of battles from the past are making today's songs, you are lucky to have a number of new recruits in the military part of the city. You will have to enlarge the system a little to
        guarantee the maximum security of your population. In fact, after thinking about it, the population of your village has been able to grow so rapidly, it is possible that enemies have had such a significant expansion, which means
        that you must absolutely anticipate.  
        <br /><br />
        On the other hand, the previously built court is unfortunately starting to work too well, and has just ordered a first prison sentence for a resident who tried to steal the museum's treasures.
        The problem is that at the moment there is no prison in the city.  
        <br /><br />
        Finally, perhaps it’s an excess of paranoia, but a book that you have read and which was brought back by one of the elders' sacrifices, indicates that there is a
        possibility that one day, the invasion having occurred 1000 years ago will happen again. You'd rather start anticipating, and start planning to build a bunker to save your people if it ever happens.
